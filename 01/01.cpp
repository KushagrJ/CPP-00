/* Trivia - 00.cpp

 * Some concepts/terms common to C and C++ may not be explained/defined here.

 * Statements normally execute sequentially. The first statement in a block is
   executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
   Programming languages also provide various flow-of-control statements that
   allow for more complicated execution paths. For eg., while, for, etc.
